# FileManager Interaction Rules

- Clicking a file card should:
  - Select the file, and
  - Toggle expand/collapse for quick preview.
- Expansion chevron must stop propagation to avoid selecting when only toggling.
- "View Game" should call an `onViewGame(fileId, gameName)` callback that:
  - Selects the file and
  - Navigates to Dashboard/Overview with that game pre-selected.
