# Development Workflow

## Project Setup
- Node.js project with Vite build tool
- React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui component library
- Development server runs on http://localhost:5173 (or next available port)

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## File Organization
- Keep components in `src/components/`
- UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- Types in `src/types/index.ts`
- Utilities in `src/utils/`
- Use absolute imports with `@/` alias

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Write meaningful component and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Testing Strategy
- Test CSV parsing with sample data
- Verify component rendering with different data states
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Validate theme switching functionality

## Deployment
- Build output goes to `dist/` directory
- Static assets served from `public/`
- Configure for production hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. Build components in `src/components/`
4. Add UI components from shadcn/ui as needed
5. Update main dashboard integration
