# Customers & Account Managers List UI

- Use bordered, hoverable rows; avoid complex internal scrolling.
- Use chevrons to expand per-row details; stopPropagation on chevron/button clicks.
- Counters and KPIs use neutral colors, avoid green for impartial metrics.
- Prefer compact spacing: `p-4`, `space-y-2`, `rounded-lg`.
- Keep actions on the right as ghost/outline buttons.
