# Table Summary KPI Labeling

All KPI titles shown inside table cards (collapsed summary area) must clearly indicate that they are averages by prefixing titles with "Average".

## Requirements
- Use English labels beginning with "Average" for summary KPIs:
  - Average D0 ROAS
  - Average D7 ROAS
  - Average Daily Install
  - Day Count (non-average count label)

## Implementation Reference
- Collapsed summary section in [src/components/GameTables.tsx](mdc:src/components/GameTables.tsx)

## Rationale
- Removes ambiguity that values are means across the displayed range.
- Keeps wording consistent across tables and deployments.
