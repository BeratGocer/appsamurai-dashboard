# Table Summary KPI Labeling

All KPI titles shown inside table cards (collapsed summary area) must clearly indicate that they are averages by prefixing titles with "Average" and use accurate calculations.

## Requirements
- Use English labels beginning with "Average" for summary KPIs:
  - Average D0 ROAS (calculated from roas_d0 column)
  - Average D7 ROAS (calculated from roas_d7 column)
  - Average Daily Install (total installs / number of days)
  - Day Count (non-average count label)

## Calculation Accuracy
- ✅ D0 ROAS must use roas_d0 column data
- ✅ D7 ROAS must use roas_d7 column data
- ✅ Never use one metric as placeholder for another
- ✅ Filter out zero values before calculating averages
- ✅ Handle empty datasets gracefully

## Implementation Reference
- Collapsed summary section in [src/components/GameTables.tsx](mdc:src/components/GameTables.tsx)

## Rationale
- Removes ambiguity that values are means across the displayed range
- Keeps wording consistent across tables and deployments
- Ensures calculations match actual data sources
- Prevents incorrect placeholder calculations
