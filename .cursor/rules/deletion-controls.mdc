# Deletion Controls in Customers/Managers

## Pattern
Provide delete buttons for files listed under both Customers and Account Managers sections. Use the existing `onFileDelete(fileId)` passed from the top-level to remove the file and update localStorage.

## Implementation Notes
- In [src/components/Dashboard.tsx](mdc:src/components/Dashboard.tsx), top-level Files list already includes a delete button (×).
- Apply the same pattern inside the expanded file items under:
  - Customers → Selected customer → Files
  - Account Managers → Selected manager → Files

## Example Button
```tsx
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  onClick={(e) => { e.stopPropagation(); onFileDelete(file.id); }}
  className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-700"
>
  ×
</Button>
```

## State
No extra state required. After deletion, if the active file is removed, `App.tsx` already sets a new active file or clears it.
